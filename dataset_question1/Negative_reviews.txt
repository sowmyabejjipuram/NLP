- I hate being lied to, the pictures for this product are nothing like the actual product i received.  The microphones i received do not work with my xbox 360 either.  Stay away from this product and the retailer Bluemall altogether.  In order to return them you have to email a rep for a rma # and i did not receive my number within their 15 day from shipping return period.  Bad business here peeps, surprised amazon would carry such trash.  Hope this helps :) 
- The CD is incorrectly stated as supported on XP but actually does not!  Waste of money. piece of junk never buy.
- If you can get this to run, it is a fun and educational game.  This does not run on xp...a great dissapointment.  I wish this was indicated on amazon before we bought it. The CD installs the game which doesn't actually run. You click the .exe file then they claim an error has occurred. I did this on three different computes, all with different operating systems. 
- The voice is delayed, and it doesn't have the volume control on the microphone. I have to use the computer to adjust the volume, not very convenient. 
- The microphone I received was used and said Disney on it. It was not compatible with any Rock Band game. 
- seems to work on my xp machine, don't know why it doesn't work on other people's.  Only thing bad about this is that the graphics are not as good as the arcade version.  But what do you expect with a game this old?  Perhaps if it was written today, it would match the arcade graphics version.  Otherwise the game is pretty awesome and has many more configuration and play modes than the arcade version.  The instructions are pretty spotty, but if you press enough keys you'll figure out how and where things are (like F1 and F2 and F4 for example) if you use keyboard. 
- large files get corrupted rather easily, can never finish season mode on Madden 08 as a result, otherwise an okay memory card. 
- It came brand new and everything but when I plugged it in it didn't even work in the game console 
- Ordered this for my son and was very disappointed when it did not work on our brand new CPU. It appears it was not compatible with our system software.  My son tried it on two relative's CPU, and it did not work on theirs.Good thing I paid only $- 
- This game would not install on any of my seven computers. The installer is so dated that if it detects any hardware that it doesn't recognize (i.e. modern hardware), it aborts. Tried all the user forum tricks I could find.  None of them helped.  Even the publisher has abandoned this game and no longer supports it.  Complete waste. Needless to say, my son was very dissappointed.  Don't bother with this one.  It's deprecated software meant for deprecated hardware. 
- The only reason I gave it one star is because it arrived to my home in a timely fashion. The game itself didn't work and there was no assistance from THQ to get it to work 
- wish I had known that my computer wouldn't support the game,  it is an old game and i have tried everything.  trying to open in different operating system etc....I should have checked. 
- This product arrived before it was scheduled to. However, the box was damaged and did not appear to be in new condition. It did look like it was unused though. The item only came with the box and disc for the software. No instructions of any kind. That was disappointing. Seller was excellent, product was good. 
- DO NOT BUY!The package inside was the wrong game? Save  yourself the money. You won't be playing civ city rome any time soon with this buy 
- I don't know about the game because I can't play it.  I have widows vista and I can download the instructions, but error comes up when I try to play the game. I contacted Ageod and they said I am the only one haveing trouble. The internet says that Vista has a lot of game problems.  I just wasted my money on this game. 
- It won't run on the new operating systems, so if you ever had the chance to play it, just keep the money and the memories. 
- Not as good as X-Box version but I hear that in 2014 all games that are for a PC will be exactly l;ike the X-box and Play Station versions. I sure hope they improve. 
- I have been unable to play this game.  Unisoft has made it unplayable if you are not a techno whiz. ( I have tried several times to get it up and running.)  I just want to play in my home not on the internet and for some reason it will not load on the computer.  I probably will never buy another UNI-SOFT game or product.. 
- The DRM is atrocious.  No one should buy a game with such a cynical and invasive wrapper.The game itself seems solid.  The interface is extremely cluttered; their UI/UX designers didn't do nearly as good of a job as they did with previous Annos.  If hell freezes over and Ubisoft decides to buck the AAA trend of putting their games in garish, grotesque cages, I'll be first in line for the DRM-free rerelease. 
- too much work to set up and play requires internet to play and too many items to set to play. 
- It was a lot of fun at first but after a few days it quickly got repetitive and really unsatisfying. There isn't much gratification in playing this game. I haven't touched it for months now. No real incentive to replay. 
- 1st shipment received a book instead of the game.2nd shipment got a FAKE one. Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box. I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content. They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD.Returned it good bye.! 
- I can't tell you what a piece of dog**** this game is. Like everything else Microsoft makes- it doesn't work. When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time. To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like 15 min. to accomplish. If you want another disappointment from Microsoft, buy some \"Games for Windows Live\" games.  I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting. If that's what you want, don't buy this. If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game, then buy it.  oh, one more thing, every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working (there's Windows 7 for you) 
- i ran it and had to fix 2 dills. then when it did run it crashed in the developer creditsDO NOT BUY THIS. 
- I still haven't figured this one out. Did everything as instructed but the game never installed. Strange. Since I don't like to rate on something I couldn't get to work, I'll just say that I didn't like it because I couldn't get it to work :P For those that did manage to get it installed, I'm sure it's a great game. I had the first Dirt and it was a scream! Too bad this one bombed.
- I bought this and Shift - Neither will run on a i5 Dell Inspiron E6420 Windows 7 Pro!? Wasted hours trying to install. I build computers and install networks, let that be a clue. Garbage when complete installation instructions are NOT included. I purchased these for my grand kids. Nothing is said about having to create an full disclosure account. Sorry, my kids privacy is more important. These go back to Amazon 
- I insert the cd into my pc and I have being waiting  35 minute and it only install about 25% 
- can somebody tell me how to set this game on the pc with the logitech G27? i connected everything very well but still the game failed to play, i mean the car couldnt move anywhere 
- I'm not used to the Xbox 360 keypad-- I wish my old Microsoft Force Feedback joystick worked with this game, but no such luck.  Also, there is too wide a gap in skill level between beginner and intermediate modes.  Unless I buy another controller, I can't do much in the tour.This game doesn't come close to the fun of Need for Speed: Most Wanted, but it uses the full capability of my laptop video card and Windows 7 64bit. 
- Too hard.  Takes 50 trys to pass level on highest difficulty.  Not fun.  Times and scores are impossible to achieve. 
- Don't like Windows live feature , I am not able to save the level I reach in the game, every time I play have to start new game 
- Had a bit of an issue with not being able to access Windows Live account
- I bought this and the key didn't work.  It was a gift, and the recipient wasn't able to solve the problem.  It might have been a good game, but I never found out because the key failed. 
- Did not like the MSN connection option or the comparisonsbetween other fictious drivers 
- Cannot save game without the online verification which is impossible at this time.
- Crashed in Vista.  Codemasters told me they don't support it in Windows -  Couldn't get it to work even after looking on the Internet. 
- the game always want to start with the CD, even after i installed it.i dont know how to fix that.it sucks... 
- This game is expensive. I already payed for it. Stop telling me that I have to freaking buy more stuff. 
- This game was a rip-off.  It has less terrain, less tracks, and less features than DiRT -  The graphics are about the same.  Not worth the money, at all. 
- If you have a job, and just want something fun to to do once in a while on a PC, look elsewhere. 
- This game is bug landFirst had problems installing because it required some windows market software. Then it did not have any voice sounds. Then it was running on windowed mode only. Now, everytime I end a track it just crashes the computer (BSoD).I give up.
- This might be a decent game if it didn't start a massive stutter every few minutes that requires alt tabbing to get out of. This is a widely known issue and I have tried numerous suggested fixes to no avail. I have never had an unfixable issue like this with a game before. If I could return it for my money back I would. 
-  I'm becoming more & more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play.  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for.  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason?  I don't care what they say publicly.   Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight, and nobody's looking.  It's quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you're being tracked, but this type of continuous spying is something more.  That aside, this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security.CONS - Requires open Internet (Windows Live) to play. 
-  Annoying interface.
-   Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do. 
-  Most settings don't keep between sessions.  
- Setting up a race takes way too long. 
-  Irritating \"music\" you can't turn off (it keeps coming back). 
-  Takes too long to unlock things. 
-  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out.
-  If I can't turn it off, and some else controls the on-off switch, that's a problem.
- This game sucked Ba**s to install, error after error.After researching on the internet for a while the solution that worked for me was copy whole game from CD to desktop folder and then installed the game. If I have to do so much work to play a game then why should I have to pay so much for it.
- Only way to fix any problem is to exit to main menu and then reload entire race, so can't use replay.Un friggin believableWORST GAME I HAVE EVER PURCHASED 
- I have several racing games, including Need For Speed the Run. Dirt 3 has been a very big disappointment. The reaction times with the controler a not responsive at the least. Graphics are shabby as well. Do not purchase!!! 
- The competitions in the game are lame and it is not a game that invites you to play. The career mode is lame in that they make you do all sorts of challenges like spinning your car and making it skid, and then different styles of racing (rally, tarmak, race with others on dirt) with lame cars.
-  the game is just boring and doesnt entice me to keep playing.
- Lacking any help from Codemasters, I've tried the various fan fixes, including uninstalling Rapture 3D. Also tried installing on Vista and Win 7 and that didn't help either, which is a shame
- The game claims to provide so much more content, however, the \"scam\" is, that you don't get that content with the game. You need to buy it. If you win races you will get a message saying \"YAY! You can now purchase your new car from the online store!!!\"OMG REALLY??? I CAN SPEND MORE MONEY ON A GAME I ALREADY PAID FOR??? NO WAY!!!!
- You can't save game progress or a profile unless you are online & have a Microsoft Live account. When I purchase a game I should have the ability (and rights!!!) to save game progress & profiles without having to be online & tracked by Microsoft. There's also all kinds of track & car add-ons that you are encouraged to buy for additional money. Overall a rip off in my opinion. No more Microsoft Live games for me!!! 
- Although this game is an amazing real to life representation of rally racing their choice in not hosting the log in servers was a bad idea.
- Wish I could review this product.  Problem is, I can't load it onto my laptop.  Tried it in compatible mode, but that doesn't work either.  
- A little detail they 'forgot' to include:IT ONLY WORKS WITH WINDOWS 95 OR EARLIERSince I (and most of us) run Windows XP or later, this game would not run on my computer. I assumed (stupid me) that games being sold as 'new' would run on current platforms. Lesson learned.IMHO, the operating system specs should ALWAYS be given. Why should I have to do research on a game to see if it will run on my computer? The sellers already know that piece of information. Why would they withhold it? 
- How can you sell a game and not know the platform? whats up with that?  let me guess you cannot read English is that correct? well look on the box idiot and see does it say XBOX? OR PS3 OR WII OR MAC OR PC.. IS IT THAT HARD TO LOOK AT THE BOX? . OR MAYBE TRY IT OUT TO SEE IF YOU ARE SELLING A WORKING COPY OF THE GAME.. SO IN THE LONG RUN YOU WANT SOMEONE ON HERE TO BE A TOTAL IDIOT NOT KNOWING THE PLATFORM AND SAY YA KNOW I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH MY MONEY TODAY SO I AM GONNA BUY A GAME THAT I HAVE NO IDEA IF I WILL EVER BE ABLE TO PLAY BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHAT PLATFORM IT IS, AND BEING THAT NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE TO READ AT THE SELLERS OFFICE .. I WILL GET IT AND THEN WHEN I GET IT FOR WHAT -00 I JUST MIGHT HAVE TO SHELL OUT ANOTHER -00 OR SO TO BE ABLE TO PLAY IT.. AMAZON SHOULD STOP YOU FROM SELLING ON HERE... 
- I tried your product and it didn't work. It just kept on saying this cd is not compatible for this computer.Can you please help me out with this?
- This book does not tell you much more than already exists in the FSX help files.It is very expensive and did not help me more after reading it.Definitely not worth.
- The card did not fit my Wii as it stated. I also check it with a friends PS2 and it don't work it it either as it said it would fit Wii & PS-.....", 
- This thing was DOA. It wasn't even worth returning for the money I spent on it. Don't waste your money on this card.", 
-  I  hate that there is in-game content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live.  Come on! I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play, so you won't really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live
- game said I needed this and couldn't use the Konami wireless mic so I bought it but the lag is soooooo bad you cant even play the game :( 
- Very disappointed. I bought this to go with the Rock Band set up that I bought for my kids for Christmas. Not the same mic that was pictured when I purchased it. Rock Band for PS3 doesn't recognize it. Kids are totally bummed. 
- We bought this item for our Wii. It does not work at all for it. :-( So that was a disapointment. We did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our x-box - 
- Are 9 out of 10 GAMECUBE games like this little kid's game terrible? Answer: YesI bought the game, and I regret it so much! 
- remote works just fine ......... from less than 5 feet away.....other than that it doesn't work at all, waste of money 
- This game is about the worst game I have ever played. I have played bad games before but this is definently the worst. the graphics are bad , The game is confusing , and is very BORING. some suggestions buy Tony Hawks Pro Skater , Nascar 98 ,99,  00 , and Rumble are some very cool games.", 
- I bought this game when i was but a young lad. I thought it would be fun because it sort of related to kids. I was sooooooo wrong. The game is too confusing and unrealistic. I mean, seriously, a bubble gun? What good is a bubble gun to a kid flying through time and space? That's the least of my worries when i get sucked into a time vortex. I tried playing this game last night because since now I'm a more experienced gamer, I might have a little fun with it. Still nothing good about this game. Too confusing, and there are a lot of time limits, which I hate. Hope this has saved you some $$ in this bad economy.", 
- It is the stupidest and hard-to-get-out-of-levels game!!!!!!!!I spend hours tring to get out of level 2!!! The next day i went to GameStop to see how much they would give me for it. The guy behind the counter said TWO DOLLARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! that is sad! A couple months later I sold it at a yard sale for $2!! Oh well, that one less game(I hate) out of my game collection! 
- MY RATING WOULD HAVE BEEN 0 STARS BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT AT LEAST 1 STAR ON THIS WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!", 
- This game is bad because it's hard to control the character and you never get to the end.  After a hour of surching you find the monsters and can't beat them.  After a while, you die.  
- I don't recamend this game to anyone.  I've had this game for a year and only played it three times.", 
- I really hated this stupid game!!!!!!!!!  I think it is the worst video game ever!!!!  I wish I could give it a 0 star!!! I think Banjo-Kazooie is one of the best platormers.  This game however really sucks!!! I wasted 10 bucks for this thinking it was good. This game should be free or taken of the market for wasting money!!!!!! Hi, Beh!!", 
- what the heck, what kind of game is this. this game was so boring i fell asleep playing it. do not waster your money on this game.", 
- I think the memory cards are just faulty, period. They save and all but when you try to retrieve the saved info to replay you get a error message which is highly disturbing.
- My son was very disappointed and wants to just try the plug in to use a sd to save the game from now on. It costs more but if it is better and does not get corrupted it is worth it. 
- I used it for GameCube and when I tried to save with multiple games it said it was corrupted and could not be formated. Do not waste your time. 
- There's not much to say about the memory card.  Either it works or it doesn't.  So far at least, it does! 
- Buying this product is one of the biggest mistakes in my life.
- Okay we have had this card for a month and has already quit on US ! and now have to start my games all over!! 1 star for at least working a month! 
- The product is the most generic thing I have ever encountered. It gets corrupt when you save larger files, meaning that you frequently have to pause the game so that it saves in smaller files. 
- Monkey ball, corrupted, metroid prime corrupted, need for speed, corrupted. This memory card is terrible and I would never buy another one. 
- Memory card didn't work complete waste of money ... Off brand - don't waste your money I wasted my money! 
- Not necessarily good or bad, but for my Wii, it goes in VERY tightly. You have to push it in all the way and pull it out hard because it sticks in there! 
- I was very displeased with this product when I received it in the mail. Firstly, I did not receive the same card as pictured.  They sent me a Wii Console memory card when my intentions were to use it for the GameCube. 
- I tried to start a new game of Super Mario SunShine,when I found that the memory card I received was not compatible with my game.  It was only 2 bucks so I can use it as a gift now, I guess. I am still extremely disappointed with this item and will not be going back to this company. 
- - The C-stick doesn't work. I know this isn't an official Nintendo controller, and you get what you pay for, but for $8, it should at least have all of the buttons function as they should. 
- Knockoff controller, so bad: stiff pads and controls. Very hard to play with especially competitive smash play do not buy this 
- What can I say? It's a third party controller, and a cheap one at that. For the most part it works fine, but with both of the controllers I purchased there is one button that either is resistant to being pushed, or else doesn't register pushing at high frequencies. 
- i didnt enjoy quake at all, you may want to try some demos, and i had some installation errors with space seige, i ended up not liking them at all 
- The adaptor that comes in this bundle does not work or at least not for me. If both the up and down arrows are pressed at the same time there is no response. The same goes for left and right. 
- Waste of money
- I wouldnt suggest this product to anyone
- I kept it just because i like the color but i was hopng for something more sturdy. 
- I bought this item because it was a great deal for both the case and the screen protector .  I removed my original screen protector that originally came with the dsi xl to replace it with the one I bought here, only to find that it didn't fit!  They gave me two screen protectors that are the same size.  The top screen however is much bigger than the bottom so it was too small.  What was worse was that it was too big for the bottom screen
- I thought I would be able to charge all 4 of my Playstation Move wands, however the ports are sized so that you can charge two and their companion controllers. Works well, just not what I had expected. 
- I bought these for our Wii remotes and they are too long.  Seems like they are made to fit the Wii remote with the motion sensor adapter.  We have original Wii remotes without the adapter and then newly purchased Wii remotes with the motion sensor built in and these skins did not fit either of those remotes. Too bad as quality seems good and colors were great. 
- It fits right, but it doesn't feel right. It feels almost greasy, and the rubber edges end where your fingertips are and will bother you a lot. In my opinion, it doesn't look very nice either, and not worth the $- (shipping)
- Didnt fit my wireless controller so i gave it to my cousin. It fit his sony controller perfectly. 
- My only complaint is that the case feels flimsy/like it is going to snap at points when I put it on or take it off the controller.  So I don't recommend taking it on and off to excess.
- I received these and they are HARD to open. I already broke one of the tabs on the blue one because it is sooo hard to open. There is 1 out of 3 that was easy to open.  I got these for my kids for xmas so we will see how long they last. I think if they were easier to open then I would be alot happier. 
- Big waste of money not worth the effort to even send them back - poor construction the tabs are hard to open and then either close toooo tight that you have to struggle to open them or you break them when opening them - JUNK ! 
- The outer tabs which hold the case closed broke on two cases the first time I tried to open them (clear and pink) and one of the pages (blue case) snapped off at the hinged tab when trying to turn it and came completely out of the case.  I'm going back to the DS branded cases, and these cases are headed to the recycle bin! 
- The tab that closes the cases is sometmes hard to open.  The little closure fasteners that keep it closed have snapped off.  There are two on each over half of the cases have lost one.  The cases still stay closed. I am just waiting for the other one to fall off and then the case will not stay closed.  The games fit nice inside but some do not hold the games as tight as I thought. 
- I would give ZERO STARS for the product.
- This skin looks good, has a great grip and is very comfortable for game playing but I soon found an unfortunate and irritating unexpected flaw - the silicone attracts pet hair like crazy.  We have a couple cats and if you're a pet owner as well you'll know that it's almost impossible to keep those follicles from sticking to your furniture and clothes in some way.
- made my hands sweat.Made it hard to play due to sweaty hands.Money wasted. 
- I was slightly dissapointed in the packaging this came in - just in a clear bag.  No markings on it at all.  I know I'll get the \"What is this?\"  reaction on it when my husband opens it for Christmas. 
- Very thin! I was really disappointed. I don't think this is going to help nearly as much as I thought it would..
- joined seam isn't cut well, so it may require some trimming to feel right. Didn't bother me enough to stop me from buying a second one
- However...tis whole perimeter has a rib around from the mold. This is downright uncomfortable. I took a light grade of sandpaper to it and after 10 minutes, wore it down. They need to reverse mold this to get rid of the rib. 
- I bought this to slow some of the wear on the finish on my controller. when installing it, i accidently ripped part of it. :-/ 
- I also noticed that when played with two dance mats there is another problem. If one player is pressing an arrow on his mat then the other player cannot press the same arrow on his mat. I could not find a solution for this so I'm going to buy another adaptor and see if that works. 
- In the first attempt only, it didnt work. Tried contacting customer care..but the response was not satisfactory.
- There are other bundles coming with Konami Dance Dance Revolution CD [Win] at Amazon.com, some of them has much better quality dance pads. 
- I ordered the dance dance revolution pc bundle (pad and cd). Well after almost a month I get the product and it's not even what I ordered .It was the dance pad and the cd however the cd doesn't work.,i'm right back where I started from.
- Downloading the game was confusing. After inserting the disk, the link came up with question marks (?). I had to change the destination from my D drive to my C drive. And also the up arrow on the pad does not work. 
- This was a great Dissapointment when I got a new computer it only works on windows 98 or less and they are not Upgrading to newer Versions Sorry!!!!!! 
- I learned a good lesson and I sure to hell not going to by anything for you people again. It seems to me that a pretty good scam you have going on!!!!!!!! 
-  This version is kinda ugly with the red bit showing always.
- The product received isn't even what is pictured.  
- WE HAVE NOT USED BECAUSE WE HAVE NEVER RECEIVED THE GAME SYSTEM THAT WE ORDERED WITH IT!
- I bought this game and I cant use the xzxzxvxz game because I have windows 8 in my computer If had of known it wouldn't workwith windows 8 I would not bought it  Also it seems very funny that you don't know about it until you payed for it. 
- Total waste of money. Since I opened it it could not be returned. I should have checked the system requirements of the game and the computer it was going to be used on much more carefully. 
- This is obviously not the stock part...that's ok, you get what you pay for.It works, but the battery life is quite short. 
- I cannot seem to get this controller to work, and I also don't believe that there is support for Mac computers.
- The product arrived, and like others I had problems. I had the random button press issues, and it was definitely on the right toggle setting (on the other toggle setting, it got constant input regardless of state, whereas sometimes I could track which buttons were being pressed on the current toggle). After playing for a little bit, I pulled the four screws out of the plastic and looked at the board. The wire soldering was not well done, and by pressing down on some of the connections I was able to stop some of the noise. Unfortunately, releasing pressure goes right back to random button presses. I'm sure some of these are well put together, but if you order it you're basically going for a crap shoot, at least on the n64 side. I don't have any PS2 controllers to try, so maybe that was done more reliably but I doubt it. 
- showed up on time and was well packed but.. when i plugged it in it didnt work with my games 
- Not work for me...I put on my computer in XP, Vista and SEVEN...I have originals controls, but, don't work... 
- This product is defective. Random button press's. Random input from everthing possible. DO NOT BUY. 
- Gave this as Christmas gift to someone who had tried the trial that came with their computer and loved the game. They were not hooked up to the internet so were unable to download it. After the game was opened and we attempted unsuccessfully to download it, we found out that it does not work with newer computers. 
- Can I give ZERO stars??!! You get what you pat for. I should have known it was a bad idea when the shipping is 3X more than the product itself. Do not get ripped off ... simply do not but this product. Does not work with my XBOX. 
- Not compatible with Wii disappointed as it was advertised that it was.  Looks like a good quality mic but cannot use it... 
- Not worth the amount we pay...
- This microphone would be perfect if it was wireless and had buttons so I didn't have to use the PS3 controller. 
- If you buy this game, you will regret it.  If you change any major component in your computer 3 times, the game will stop working permanently. And it will never work again. So, if you plan to play this game a few years from now, you will not be able to do so.  Is this some horrible bug? No - this is intentional. It is a scheme to get people to buy the same game over and over again.  This should be illegal.  So, if you want to actually play games you buy, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!! 
- Hawk 1 is alot better than - Not worth  wasting money on. I was really disappointed in the lack of energy they put into making this game. get free gift cards from walmart, amazon, staples and much more just by clicking a button and obtaining points. Never costs a penny to you!!!!  Get 50 point sign on bonus bye using this link [...] 
- I loved the first Hawx PC game when it came out. Playing Hawx 2 got boring after several missions, is just a shame. 
- They work great for awhile but now I have had 3 break and stop working completely. 
- didn't work correctly 
- I got this game on Amazon because it had a very good price, but upon receiving it i downloaded the game, but it would not run. It said it needed updates but the auto updater would not work. I was able to get a full refund very quickly and I am happy about that but very disappointed that the game i had anticipated so long would not run. 
- I think the memory cards are just faulty, period. They save and all but when you try to retrieve the saved info to replay you get a error message which is highly disturbing. My son was very disappointed and wants to just try the plug in to use a sd to save the game from now on. It costs more but if it is better and does not get corrupted it is worth it. 
- I was not aware that this game is to be installed only on older computers.  I was unable to install on my computer!!
- i love this game but when i ordered it an got it home u can not play it on computers iwth windows vista or newer then 98 windows an i bought it 2 times an cant play niether one of them. 
- Do what they are supposed to do nothing special.  I dont like the PS3 controller anyway. Sony must think we all have tiny hands or something. 
- This memory card is worthless. My PS2 could not recognize it, and wouldn't save to it either. Take heed, and stay far away from this apparent \"bargain\".
- This looks like the ones made by MadCatz. I bought 2 of these at Circuit City and by the next day after using them... both Wii Fits were dead.
- In my case, and only one card worked and wouldn't format so I chucked it. I only needed one anyway so I kept that one. They were in separate packages, so I guess that's about a 50% chance of any given card working?  Buyer beware. 
- So for your own sanity (and $45 saved if you are past your 3 month warranty with the WII Fit Board) do not even take the chance by using this product.  You'll be thankful, believe me.
- I managed to save one game on this card before I started getting corrupt file errors all the time. Basically worthless because there are too many corrupt blocks to save any games on this with any reliability.", 
- The product shown is NOT what you receive. You actually get two of the black skin cases and no grey ones with the grip dots.  
- The product sucks !!!
- The graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements. Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing.                                                   The controls at times were clunky and unresponsive, and I would often find myself piloting Manny into a wall.  The gameplay was rigidly linear, often arbitrarily so, and I was much more dependent on a walkthrough while playing the game than I normally am.So, as part of the video game medium, I can't give Grim Fandango a perfect rating because it was so frustrating at times .                              It is the same interface (almost) later used in the (dissapointing) fourth Monkey Island game. While it is better used in this game, it still isn't as good as the old mouse system. If there is any complaint to make about this game, it is that.
- But there's one major, and I mean MAJOR problem with this game.  This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life.  Remember your family?  
- the game wasn't subjected to as much quality control as it should have been (something LucasArts sadly makes a habit of), and it can be glitchy, with the game freezing up occasionally. This is of course frustrating and annoying, and in any other game I would not have bothered to finish because of it.
- the game's okay, although i don't think making the charactersin 3d was a very good idea, plus at some points game gets outrightboring,and all the main characters smoke...  although the game will crash sometimes, and it might get stuck, overall, the game is pretty much okay if you don't count crashes and how the characters act and look...  END
- It's not the game's fault but I dropped a star because of the difficulty in getting it to run. I need a &#34;older game guru&#34; to help!
- THE BADS OF THE GAMEThere are some major glitches.  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls, not completely, but almost there.At times the doors, when I command it to open with the B button, it still won't open, even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place.  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well, but how am I supposed to know that?
- You can easily die in this game just due to glitches, which makes it very difficult and frustrating.If you forget one thing on a mission, just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story, then you have to start the whole mission over again.  
- The game is predictible, due to the fact that it follows the movie, although when it does not follow the movie, (Which it does a lot) then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen.The puzzles can be frustrating
- I'm still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level.The game is also very gory.  I don't know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a mature...it should of been rated mature.Now, for the GOODS of this game.GOODSUse an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponry...prepare to save the world, it's gonna be a rough ride.
- Game wont start. i havent had time to send back. chalking it up as a loss at this point..
- Soundwise, it's not the biggest strength of the game.
- The game is not without flaws of course. For example, if you drop a tracking device you were suppose to put on something you fail the mission.  Why can't you just pick it up and place it correctly?  
- The animation is very realistic but the facial expressions on the characters are static.  For example, if a guy is happy he will remain happy even when he's dying with five bullets in his head.  
- Some of the objectives are pointless such as destroying the gun drones and the weapon cache in the Jungle level.  
- The game doesn't follow the movie completely.  For example,  The plane on the runway is just sitting there instead of you having to chase after it on a motorcycle.
- \"Goldeneye 007\", at first glance, looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated \"First-Person\" shooter game genre.
- I think some of the levels could be better. Facility and bunker are cool, but others like surface should have been in there.
- It has superb graphics, although there can be serious glitches such as slowdown and shoddy colision detection.
- one of the biggest time wasters of my child hood. I have not replayed this since I bought it, so I'm not 100% it holds up to time...
- So I got this game from what I thought would be reliable dealer. It saved and it was great at first! But after a month or so all of a sudden my progress was gone!! I then realized that it wouldn't save if it was off for a little while so i had to keep it plugged it ALL the time. So stressful! I went so far in the game and of coarse i didnt notice it wasnt fully plugged in and my memory was gone. Well anyways i thought i'd share my experience.
- This is a fake version of pokemon blue! The stickers and cartridge cooler aren't correct! He's trying to rip us off! And its a shame because he's one of a very few amount of people who actually post pictures of the items their selling. Its to bad this game is a fake!
- It didn't save so I had to change the battery inside the cardtrige.
- The game is overrated. Don't get sucked into all the hype. It's more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out.
- The graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like you're drunk. 
- For the first one week it worked fine and then it stopped working completely. Now I dnt   know what to do with it. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.
- I regret buying it :(
- This game is not worth the money
- In worst condition!
- Installation process is tideous.
- havent recieved my package yet... the order said it was going to be here in 3-5 days.... its been more than 10 days now... and its the 16th or september and i checked the tracking package and it said it MIGHT be here the 20th.... getting realli irritated and frustrated!
- this one is not the original expansion
- Not exactly what I expected.
- I was a tad disappointed that we had to buy this thing in order to play racing games
- Software has lot of malfunctions.
- Hard to understand the installation procedure.
- i cant figure out how to get out of the game, very irritating.
- The game irritates the gamers with its delay.
- the dealer did not let me know i needed a key to get the jumper pack out!
- This game is not a TOTAL blast!!
- This game is not a get game if you like games with cars and racing.
- The controls take long to get used to, very confusing!
- the controls are horrible and some of the worst I've experienced when trying to shoot something. 
- i have not finished  the game and it stuck on every level 
- This is not one of the BEST GAMES out for the Company Playstation.
- The graphics are not the bast and the missions are brainless
- This game does not have everything you need for a proper racing.
- The plot is very bad.
- it makes you feel like you're not in the game
- - seriously the gameplay is terrible.
- This game has crappy graphics,that we can all agree.
- I think this game is is the stupidest game I have played in my life
- The graphics are messed up and the voice acting is terrible. 
- The game is so frustrating and not fun at all. Overall, avoid this game at all costs.
- My one and only problem with the game is  the sparcity of Mulder and Scully appearances throughout.  They don't show  up until disk five, and after that they have little involvement.
- This was not the best mystery/adventure game I've ever played, and I'm not even a big fan of such games to begin with, but I am a serious X-Phile.  
- Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game, it wasn't a whole lot like being in an X-Files episode.  Instead, it was more like being one of those &quot;other agents&quot; who make brief appearances two or three times per season.  
- If you're not a fan of The X-Files, there are better mystery/adventure games out there.  If you find mystery/adventure games frustrating, you probably won't like this one even if you are a fan.  
- I've heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more,
- Well I'm a hard core X-Files fan and video gamer so I do know what I'm talking about when I say that this game was not 100% satisfying.  
- The problem was  that your Craig Wilmore. This guy kind of sucks. You don't even see Mulder  and Scully until the later Cd's in the game.  
- Plus the plot isn't really  that strong for it... if your a big X-Files fan you know what I mean, other  than the fact that Scully is unbelievabely HOT, I watch the x-files because  they have such good story telling.  If this game was turned into an  episode, I guarantee it would not be one of your favorites.  
- You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial. Or because you died (I got killed a lot too). You  need lots of frequent saves, and a few less recent, and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game.
- I thought this game would be great; I'm a big X-Files fan.  But it was really boring.  It was just a matter of finding the right place to be at the right time; no puzzles, no actions that would affect the flow of the  game.  You just wander from one place to the other.  
- It was cool to be able  to interact with Mulder and Scully, but other than that, this game was a  waste of time.
- The game moves very  slowly unfortunately, and you may find yourself frequently returning to  places for clues or things you have missed.
- The game's puzzles never get  too frustrating, but sometimes, the game can really drag because sometimes,  you just simply don't know where to go next. It's easy to miss valuable  information.
- Storyline is good if not a little complicated. It was really hard to figure out several steps. I recommend you have time on your hands before trying the game.
- First of all on this game the graphics Suck very badly You have a limited number of moves you can perform. Also You don't always play as obi-wan OR Qui-gon Jinn This game is extremely difficult to beat the third level is almost impossible to beat. All in all i wouldn't waste my money on this Piece of $h!t game. if your a diehard star wars fan go for it but dont plan on Beating it.
- This game is horrible first of all the play is slow. This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging! The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game. The voice overs are soo weak! It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval. This doens't even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details. This is a must not buy and a huge letdown. Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost 20 years and especially with all the new technology around. Don't buy this game!
- all the bad reviews are right, the controls are confusing and the game becomes frustrating because you keep falling off cliffs without knowing why. then you have to go back to the last checkpoint and do the same thing again and again just hoping for the best and not really playing anymore.
- This game does not have lots of action, stealth, strategy 
- This is not the game of all games. 
- This game does not rock the most.
- The game concept seems dull and unappealing
- This is the worst game I have ever played.
- This game is VERY annoying, and can get tiring easily. The thing I don't like about it is that it only lets you play game stages, and you get bored easily. The annoying thing about it is that when you move in a special way, like flying, the person that is moving will make a very annoying sound. I wouldn't buy it.
- This game was highly dispicable.  I had a horrible time playing super smash bros.  the game was extremely boring and it had no point in it.  all i did was fight against other stupid cartoon characters.  i think this game gets a four ONLY because it is extremely easy...so i was able to beat it.  
- Not a very good game in fact.
- The first (and biggest) disappointment is that you have to play a guy named Craig Willmore.  I was hoping to play Scully or Mulder.  But the video shots of them were very nice indeed, though you have to wait until the end to see them.Then, I think it is actually very weird to play at some points, because sometimes POV ends up in awkward angles.  
- It seems as if the POV changes at some points.  I didn't like that either.Even after that, It was too easy.  I beat the entire game in one weekend.  ...I recommend it ONLY for rabid X-Files fans.  All other people will probably not be impressed.
- First of all, I'd like to say that if you don't like mystery games you shouldn't even attempt to buy this game.
- A negative thing I have to say about this game is that at some points in the game it just turns out to be a scavenger hunt for eviedence.
- And Scully really irritates u a lot in this game. All i could do was shoot her in the game. I ended up in jail. If there was more choices, i would have pissed her off in the game. I mean seriously, u go to help her, she behaves like she's the queen of the world.
- there wasnt much action or a spooky feel to it.
- the biggest drawback was that u dont get much of mulder and scully.
- I used to love this game; but now it's dated and now that I look back on it, it's not as fun now.
- Very, very realistic and solid, but It's frustrating for that reason. it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land, which can be frustrating for little kids.
- There is also damage; so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race.
- They need to make a better game than this.Only 8 boarders to choose from.Only 7 courses.The one who came up with this must be FIRED!
- Now, the only lack I have seem to find in this game is the lack of characters. There is only about five of them.
- Not much to say about multiplayer, because it does not really shine in that area. It's just an addition to the things you can do in this game besides beat it.
- i think it could easily be improved.  They should make you have a little more freedom like you do in other types of games.  They should also make a season type mode where you go through a bunch of races and stuff.  
- this is the stuppidiest game i've ever played. I advise everyone not to play it or buy it. It really sucked.
- The bad part about it being easy is that i can not concentrate and get a good full length time of playing because it is so very dull.  thank for this opportunity to express my feelings about this horrible..terrifying game.
